                    <p class="para">"Hi, I'm Shannon (I also go by Purriin or Popurriin on the internet, depending on availability of the former). 
                        I am currently a second year Computer Engineering student studying at 
                        the University of Toronto. I love to learn and create new things. As such, I <i>may </i>
                        have too many hobbies: coding, visual arts, knitting, crocheting, video editing, reading, 
                        journaling, and probably more to come in the future! I hope to pursue a career that allows 
                        me to embrace my creative side, whether it be to solve real world problems or to create 
                        something with recreational value."

                            to GitHub. I had a ton of fun working on it and learned a lot about developing websites. 
                            I found this project to be an excellent way to learn the tools and want to apply this 
                            strategy to learn other tools (My next goal: JavaScript & React). In addition, this website

                            process to funnel our ideas. Our top design was a titanium dioxide coating with which we created a testable
